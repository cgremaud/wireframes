# Description

*This repo is deprecated. See[(The main repo](https://github.com/LaunchCodeLiftoffProjects/gab-group-a/tree/colyns-branch) for the latest version of this code.*

This repo is where I store designs, prototypes and wireframes for frontend components of the Helping Hands app. 

Helping Hands is my capstone project for LaunchCode's Liftoff program. It is a mutual aid app designed to connect people in need with their neighbors who can share. 

My design goal is to create an easy-to-use app to connect members of a community so that they can share their resources, labor and skills to help each other build better communities, whether that's by starting a community garden, donating school supplies, or starting a little free library. 

# Info

This app was created using create-react-app. It also utilizes Material Design components and Bootstrap CDN CSS. 

I am currently working on building the NavBar, Profile and Home components. 

You can see our plans for the layout of the app [here](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/10wdWoqieyv-g_UfqlVWKFR4Jl3XWTR9O6qH7-81oGIA/edit?usp=sharing)
